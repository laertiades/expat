  United States citizens living abroad are required to file annual U.S. income tax returns and report their worldwide income if they meet the minimum income filing requirements for their filing status and age. However, as an expatriate with a tax home in a foreign country, you may be eligible to exclude up to $99,200 of your foreign earned income from US taxation for the 2014 tax year by meeting one of two tests. In addition, you may also be able to deduct part of your qualifying housing cost and receive a credit for income taxes paid to a foreign government. Please note that US Government employees do not qualify for the exclusions mentioned above.
